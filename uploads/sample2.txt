Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. 
To succeed in business, you must create and deliver real value. The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Great companies start because the founders want to change the world, not make a fast buck.
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity, not a threat. A good idea becomes great when it is put into action.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do. Innovation requires passion and a willingness to take risks.
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do.
Success is not just about making money, itâ€™s about making a difference. Success and innovation go hand in hand.
If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.
Creativity is contagious. Pass it on.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
